## One-line positioning

YNX is a **governance-native EVM chain for real Web3 services**.

## Why users choose YNX

- Mainnet-parity workflow: public testnet behavior is intentionally aligned with planned mainnet logic.
- Governance transparency: operators can inspect governance/fee-routing metadata through API.
- Fast onboarding: copy/paste node deployment and one-command health verification.
- Early ecosystem leverage: builders and validators can enter with lower coordination friction.

## Against larger chains

YNX does not compete by claiming the largest liquidity today.  
YNX competes on:

- execution transparency,
- operational clarity,
- governance readability,
- early participation upside for builders and validator operators.

## Machine-readable positioning endpoint

- `GET /ynx/overview`

Includes:

- governance metadata,

- positioning statement and reasons.
